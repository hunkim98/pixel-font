This font is created after my own Kinder-modeled handwriting. It is designed to be simple and clean! It is a .ttf (True-Type Font) file in a zipped folder. You'll need to unzip (right click and select "extract") the folder in order to access the font to install.

Includes all uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numerals and main punctuation characters.

Permissions:

You can use this font to create personal use and/or commercial use items.
